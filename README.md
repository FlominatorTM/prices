# prices
compare prices while being in a shop without internet access 

currrently not much more than a public backup and more hack than actual application, which was based on a Knockout javascript example that a former colleague built years ago

my workflow:
1. adding prices from bill after shopping to Kilopreise.ods
2. uploading that file to webserver containing server folder
3. downloading JSON data from DownloadData.php into Download folder on phone
4. executing client folder on my phone by opening file:///sdcard/shopping/Customer.html
